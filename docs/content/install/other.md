There are other ways to install PyTNL in specific environments, including
running plain `cmake` commands or using a different Python build frontend
such as [build](https://pypi.org/project/build/). See the [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/tnl-project/pytnl/-/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml?ref_type=heads) file
for examples and do not hesitate to get in touch in case of questions!
