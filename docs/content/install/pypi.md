PyTNL can be installed [PyPi] using any
Python package manager, e.g. `pip`:

```shell
pip install pytnl
```

!!! warning

    PyTNL currently publishes only a [source distribution (sdist)][sdist]
    so this step involves building the binary modules on your own system.
    For this to work, several [dependencies](./dependencies.md) must be installed.
