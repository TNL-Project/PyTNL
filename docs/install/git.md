The latest development version can be installed directly from
the git repository instead of the stable release from [PyPI](pypi.md).

```shell
pip install git+https://gitlab.com/tnl-project/pytnl.git
```

Alternatively, if you need to make changes to the sources, see [Development](dev.md).

!!! warning

    This step involves building PyTNL from source, you need to have installed all [dependencies](dependencies.md)
